# Project Overview

This project is a web-based application, that reads RSS feeds, provided by Udacity for Front End Web Development Nanodegree. The objective of this project is to write the incomplete test and make sure all tests are passing.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## Tools used
- Jasmine
- jQuery


## How to get started?
- Clone the repo to your local machine
- Jasmine is already included in the head of the index.html file, so installation is not required
- To start playing with the tests open the spec file, 'spec/feedreader.js' in your preferred text editor
- Open the index.html file in your favourite browser
- Change or write tests and refresh the page to check if the tests are passing
- Use live preview(if your text editor has it) or other tools of your choice to see the results of the changes without refreshing the page.
